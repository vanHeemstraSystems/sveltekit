## What is SvelteKit?

Svelte offers a productive approach to facilitating the creation of frontend interfaces. Its app framework, SvelteKit, is a static site generator for Jamstack. Just as Next is helpful when working with React, SvelteKit would be highly needed by Svelte developers. It offers server-side rendering, code-splitting, components for serverless platforms, routing and many more features.

Whatâ€™s different here, however, is that SvelteKit proposes a different approach than the very popular front-end frameworks like React, Vue or Angular. Since these frameworks do most of the work in the user's browser, e.g. handling a virtual DOM, Svelte goes through a compilation step. The results are high-performance and browser-friendly JavaScript with small package sizes.

While Svelte application build process is the biggest innovation of the framework, it's also very easy to learn, has great documentation, and comes with great experience testimonials from developers.
